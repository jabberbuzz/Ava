Ava php framework for web api. It also opensource and using MIT license. It's using MVC strcuture and OOP. Written by PHP 5.3. There is a just design for MVC. It still alpha version and http://user.mysteryzillion.org is using Ava.

What is the mean of Ava ?
--------------------------

Innwa (Burmese: အင်းဝမြို့; MLCTS: ang: wa. mrui.; formerly Ava, and sometimes Ainwa) is a city in the Mandalay Division of Burma (Myanmar), situated just to the south of Amarapura on the Ayeyarwady River.

Is it fork from CodeIgniter ?
-----------------------------

No. It's not fork of CodeIgniter. I wrote base on Ava-light framework. I just use io class from CodeIgniter because of XSS clean code is awesome in CodeIgniter.

Framework Design may look like CodeIgniter because I love CodeIgniter. I used CodeIgniter too much time in my previous works. So, Ava may look like CodeIgniter Framework. But it's not fork repo. It's a another new and design is **ease to develop for your own framework** and ease to develop web application.

What api already include ?
------------------------------

I added following api

 - facebook 
 - openid 
 - gravatar 
 - recaptcha
 
twitter api in the future.
